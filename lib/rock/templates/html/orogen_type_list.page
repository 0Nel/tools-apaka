This page lists all the types that have been exported through oroGen, i.e. that are being used in oroGen tasks.

For each type, three informations are given:

 * <b>the C++ type definition</b>, that is the definition of the type in C++ (as
   given to oroGen). [Opaque
   types]({relocatable: /documentation/orogen/opaque_types.html}) are not explicitely
   represented in oroGen and are therefore not displayed.
 * <b>Logging</b> is the type definition as saved in log files. It differs from
   the C++ type only for opaque types.
 * <b>Ruby</b> is the type definition as manipulated in Ruby. It differs from
   the C++ type for opaque types, and in cases where [custom
   convertions]({relocatable: /documentation/runtime/ruby_and_types.html}) have been
   defined.
